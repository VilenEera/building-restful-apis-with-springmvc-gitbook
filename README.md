Introduction
===========

In this step-by-step minibook, I will demonstrate how to implement a RESTful web application with Spring MVC and AngularJS.

The sample codes is hosted on my Github.com account.

[https://github.com/hantsy/angularjs-springmvc-sample](https://github.com/hantsy/angularjs-springmvc-sample)

In this sample application, the following technologies are used to build the backend REST API.

1. **Spring** framework is the infrastructure of the sample codes.
2. **JPA** is responsible of the data persistence, and **Hibernate** is chosen as the JPA provider in the sample code. **Spring Data(JPA)** is used to simplify the data operations.
3. **Spring MVC** is used to produce REST APIs.
4. **Spring Security** is the guard of this application and it will secure the REST APIs.

The frontend UI is consist of the static pages, which is written with AngularJS/Bootstrap. It will be a SPA(Single Page Application) application.
